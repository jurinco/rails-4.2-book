Ruby Basics
===========

Introduction
------------

This book requires basic knowledge of HTML, plus the reader - you, in other 
words - should also have a basic understanding of programming.

A couple of years ago I made the mistake of trying to understand Ruby on Rails 
without knowing anything about Ruby. Ruby just looked so simple, so I didn't 
give it another thought. But because I did not have a basic understanding of 
Ruby, I was not able to understand Rails properly. So I kept shunting it into 
a virtual corner and carried on working with PHP instead. One can only feel 
the magic of Rails after understanding the basics of Ruby.

The inventor of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto, states in his book “The Ruby 
Programming Language” that:

“It is easy to program in Ruby, but Ruby is not a simple language.”

This chapter is a tightrope walk between oversimplification and a degree of 
detail that is unnecessary for a Rails newbie. After all, the objective is not 
becoming a Ruby guru, but understanding Ruby on Rails. I am going to elaborate 
on the most important points. The rest is then up to you. If you would like to 
know more about Ruby, then I recommend the book "The Ruby Programming 
Language" by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto.

Because Ruby version 2.2 is the way to go we use it. Please take care to update 
your current Ruby if you are running older versions. Truth be told: For most 
part of this book you'll be fine with versions 2.0 and 2.1 too - but we tested 
everything with version 2.2.

The command `ruby -v` will print the current running Ruby version:

```bash
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin14]
$
```

Hello World
-----------

Ruby is a scripting language. So it is not compiled and then executed, but 
read by an interpreter and then processed line by line.

A simple Ruby program `hello-world.rb` consist of the following line:

```ruby
puts 'Hello World!'
```

Use your favorite editor to open a new file with the filename `hello-world.rb` 
and insert the above line into it. You can then execute this Ruby program in 
the command line as follows:

```bash
$ ruby hello-world.rb
Hello World!
$
```

A program line in a Ruby program does not have to end with a semicolon.
The Ruby interpreter is even so intelligent that is recognizes if a
program line was split over two or more lines for the sake of
readability. I will spare you the corresponding examples and am only
mentioning this so you don't say or think later, "is it okay like this?"

Indenting code is also not necessary. But it does make it much easier to
read for human beings!

### puts and print

If you go looking for examples on Ruby on the Internet, you will find two 
typical ways of printing text on the screen:

-   `puts`

    Prints a string, followed by a newline.

-   `print`

    Prints a string (without newline). If the string itself contains a
    newline, this will be printed as normal.

Example program (an extension of the program `hello-world.rb`):

```ruby
puts 'Hello World!'
puts
puts '------------'
print 'Hello World!'
print
puts '------------'
```

On the screen, you will see this:

```bash
$ ruby hello-world.rb
Hello World!

------------
Hello World!------------
$
```

### Comments

comments
Ruby
A comment in a Ruby program starts with a `#`-sign and ends with a newline. 
As an example, I can add a comment to the `hello-world.rb` above:

```ruby
# Program for displaying "Hello World!"
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
```

A comment can also follow a program line:

```ruby
# Program for displaying "Hello World!"
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'  # output
```

A `#`-sign within strings in inverted commas is not treated as the start of a 
comment. Example program:

```ruby
# Example program
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
puts '############'
puts
puts '1#2#3#4#5#6#'  # Comment on this
```

On the screen, you will see this:

```bash
$ ruby hello-world.rb
Hello World!
############

1#2#3#4#5#6#
$
```

### Help via ri

When programming, you do not always have a Ruby handbook available.
Fortunately, the Ruby developers thought of this and provided a built-in
help feature in form of the program `ri` (of course only if you have
installed the documentation). ri is the abbreviation for “**R**uby
**I**ndex”. The output gets opend in a so called pager (z.B. `less`).
The parameter `-T` sets the output directly to stdout.

This is a typical chicken and egg situation. How can I explain the Ruby
help feature, if we are only just getting started with Ruby? So I am
going to jump ahead a little and show you how you can search for
information on the class String:

```bash
$ vi String
= String < Object

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
= Includes:
Comparable (from ruby site)

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BigDecimal extends the native String class to provide the #to_d method.

When you require BigDecimal in your application, this method will be available
on String objects.





additions to class String for Unicode normalization

A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically 
representing characters. String objects may be created using String::new 
or as literals.

Because of aliasing issues, users of strings should be aware of the methods
that modify the contents of a String object.  Typically, methods with names
ending in ``!'' modify their receiver, while those without a ``!'' return a
new String.  However, there are exceptions, such as String#[]=.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
$
```

If we are looking for information on a specific method (chicken-egg!), then we 
can also use `ri`. Let's take gsub as an example. This is a method for 
replacing parts of a String (that is useful now and again).

```bash
$ ri String.size
= String.size

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  str.size     -> integer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns the character length of str.
```

The program `ri` always prints the output in the pager program defined
by the shell (for example `less`). You can also use the command option
`-T` to output everything directly to STDOUT. In the book I am going to
be using both variations.

irb
---

irb stands for “**I**nteractive **R**u**b**y” and is a kind of sandbox
where you can play around with Ruby at your leisure. irb is launched by
entering `irb` on the shell and ends if you enter `exit`.

An example is worth a thousand words:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

> **Note**
>
> I use `irb --simple-prompt` to generate shorter lines which make it
> easier to read this book on mobile devises.

In this chapter, we develop many examples within irb. It is so
wonderfully quick and easy.

### Comments in irb

Having comments within `irb` would obviously rarely make sense because
code developed in `irb` is more or less code for the bin. But within
this book, we occasionally use comments even in `irb` to make things
clearer. You can copy these comments along with everything else and
insert them into the `irb` without any problems, or you can simply omit
them.

Ruby is Object-Oriented
-----------------------

Ruby only knows objects. Everything is an object (sounds almost like
Zen). Every object is an instance of a class. You can find out the class
of an object via the method .class.

An object in Ruby is encapsulated and can only be reached from the
outside via the methods of the corresponding object. What does this
mean? I cannot change any property of an object directly from the
outside. The corresponding object has to offer a method with which I can
do so.

### Methods

In other programming languages, the terms you would use for Ruby methods
would be: functions, procedures, subroutines and of course methods.

> oriented programming languages with OO onces. Plus there are two kinds

> distinctions for now.

At this point you start looking for a good example, but all you can
think of are silly ones. The problem is the premisse that we are only
allowed to use knowledge that has already been described previously in
this book.

So let's assume that we use the following code sequence repeatedly - for
whatever reason:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
>> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
>> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

So we want to output the string “Hello World!” three times in a row. As
this makes our daily work routine much longer, we are now going to
define a method (with the meaningless name three\_times), with which
this can all be done in one go.

> **Important**
>
> Names of methods are always written in lower case.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> def three_times
>>   puts 'Hello World!'
>>   puts 'Hello World!'
>>   puts 'Hello World!'
>> end
=> :three_times
>> three_times
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
```

When defining a method, you can define required parameters and use them
within the method. This enables us to create a method to which we pass a
string as parameter and we can then output it three times.

```bash
>> def three_times(value)
>>   puts value
>>   puts value
>>   puts value
>> end
=> :three_times
>> three_times('Hello World!')
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
```

Incidentally, you can omit the brackets when calling the method.

```bash
>> three_times 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
```

If you do not specify a parameter with the above method, you will get
the error message: “`wrong number of arguments (0 for
      1)`”:

```bash
>> three_times
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
    from (irb):1:in `three_times'
    from (irb):6
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
$
```

You can give the variable `value` a default value and then you can also
call the method without parameter:

```bash
$ irb --simple_prompt
>> def three_times(value = 'blue')
>>   puts value
>>   puts value
>>   puts value
>> end
=> :three_times
>> three_times('Hello World!')
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> three_times
blue
blue
blue
=> nil
>> exit
```

### Classes

A class is a collection of methods. The name of a class always starts
with an upper case letter. Let's assume that the method belongs to the
new class This\_and\_that. It would then be defined as follows in a Ruby
program:

```ruby
class This_and_that
  def three_times
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
end
```

Let's play it through in `irb`:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class This_and_that
>>   def three_times
>>     puts 'Hello World!'
>>     puts 'Hello World!'
>>     puts 'Hello World!'
>>   end
>> end
=> :three_times
>>
```

Now we try to call the method three\_times:

```bash
>> This_and_that.three_times
NoMethodError: undefined method `three_times' for This_and_that:Class
  from (irb):8
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>>
```

This results in an error message, because This\_and\_that is a class and
not an instance. As we are working with instance methods, it only works
if we have first created a new object (a new instance) of the class
This\_and\_that with the class method new:

```bash
>> abc = This_and_that.new
=> #<This_and_that:0x007fc6f306bd70>
>> abc.three_times
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

I will explain the difference between instance and class methods in more detail in [the section called "Class Methods and Instance Methods"](http://www.xyzpub.com/en/ruby-on-rails/4.0/ruby-ist-objekt-orientiert.html#class_methods_vs_instance_methods). Another chicken and egg problem.

#### Private Methods

Quite often it makes sense to only call a method within its own class or
own instance. Such methods are referred to as private methods (as
opposed to public methods), and they are listed below the keyword
`private` within a class.

irb example:
```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Example
>>   def a
>>     puts 'a'
>>   end
>>   private
>>   def b
>>     puts 'b'
>>   end
>> end
=> :b
>> abc = Example.new
=> #<Example:0x007fbb3383b1e8>
>> abc.a
a
=> nil
>> abc.b
NoMethodError: private method `b' called for #<Example:0x007fbb3383b1e8>
  from (irb):13
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
$
```

#### Method initialize()

If a new instance is created (by calling the method new), the method
that is processed first and automatically is the method initialize. The
method is automatically a private method, even if it not listed
explicitly under `private`.

irb example:
```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Room
>>   def initialize
>>     puts 'abc'
>>   end
>> end
=> :initialize
>> kitchen = Room.new
abc
=> #<Room:0x007fba8b050350>
>> exit
$
```

The instance `kitchen` is created with `Room.new` and the method
initialize is processed automatically.

The method new accepts the parameters specified for the method
initialize:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Example
>>   def initialize(value)
>>     puts value
>>   end
>> end
=> :initialize
>> abc = Example.new('Hello World!')
Hello World!
=> #<Example:0x007f8389040088>
>> exit
$
```

#### return

puts is nice to demonstrate an example in this book but normally you
need a way to return the result of something. The `return` statement can
be used for that:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> def area_of_a_circle(radius)
>>   pi = 3.14
>>   area = pi * radius * radius
>>   return area
>> end
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> area_of_a_circle(10)
=> 314.0
>> exit
```

But it wouldn't be Ruby if you couldn't do it shorter. You can simply
skip return:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> def area_of_a_circle(radius)
>>   pi = 3.14
>>   area = pi * radius * radius
>>   area
>> end
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> area_of_a_circle(10)
=> 314.0
>> exit
```

You can actually even skip the last line because Ruby returns the value
of the last expression as a default:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> def area_of_a_circle(radius)
>>   pi = 3.14
>>   area = pi * radius * radius
>> end
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> area_of_a_circle(10)
=> 314.0
>> exit
```

`return` is sometimes useful to make a method easier to read. But you
don't have to use it in case you feel more comfortable with out.

#### Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class. When defining the class, the
parent class must be added with a `<` (smaller than) sign:

```ruby
class Example < ParentClass
```

Rails makes use of this approach very frequently (otherwise I would not
be bothering you with it).

In the following example, we define the class Abc and which contains the
methods a, b and c. Then we define a class Abcd and let it inherit the
class Abc and add a new method d. The new instances `example1` and
`example2` are created with the Class-Methods new and show that
`example2` has access to the methods a, b, c and d but `example1` only
to a, b and c.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Abc
>>   def a
>>     'a'
>>   end
>>   def b
>>     'b'
>>   end
>>   def c
>>     'c'
>>   end
>> end
=> :c
>> class Abcd < Abc
>>   def d
>>     'd'
>>   end
>> end
=> :d
>> example1 = Abc.new
=> #<Abc:0x007f827b958a30>
>> example2 = Abcd.new
=> #<Abcd:0x007f827b931610>
>> example2.d
=> "d"
>> example2.a
=> "a"
>> example1.d
NoMethodError: undefined method `d' for #<Abc:0x007fc73a0731c8>
    from (irb):19
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> example1.a
=> "a"
>> exit
$
```

#### Class Methods and Instance Methods

There are two important kinds of methods: class methods and instance
methods.

You now already know what a class it. And an instance of such a class is
created via the class method `new`. A class method can only be called in
connection with the class (for example, the method `new` is a class
method). An instance method is a method that only works with an
instance. So you cannot apply the method `new` to an instance.

Let's first try to call an instance method as class method:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Knowledge
>>   def pi
>>     3.14
>>   end
>> end
=> :pi
>> Knowlegde.pi
NameError: uninitialized constant Knowlegde
  from (irb):6
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
```

So that does not work. Well, then let's create a new instance of the
class and try again:

```bash
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fce04039bf0>
>> example.pi
=> 3.14
>> exit
$
```

Now we just need to find out how to define a class method. Hardcore
Rails gurus would now whisk you away into the depths of the source code
and pick out examples from the ActiveRecord. I will spare you this and
show an abstract example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Knowledge
>>   def self.pi
>>     3.14
>>   end
>> end
=> :pi
>> Knowledge.pi
=> 3.14
>>
```

And the proof to the contrary:

```bash
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007ffda3050980>
>> example.pi
NoMethodError: undefined method `pi' for #<Knowledge:0x007ffda3050980>
  from (irb):7
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
$
```

There are different notations for defining class methods. The two most
common ones are:

-   `self.xyz`

```ruby
# Variant 1
# with self.xyz
#
class Knowledge
  def self.pi
    3.14
  end
end
``` 

-   `class << self`

```ruby
# Variant 2
# with class << self
#
class Knowledge
  class << self
    def pi
      3.14
    end
  end
end
```   

The result is always the same.

Of course you can use the same methodname for a class and an instance
method. Obviously that doesn't make any code easier to understand. Here
is an example with `pi as a class and an instance method:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Knowledge
>>   def pi
>>     3.14
>>   end
>>   def self.pi
>>     3.14159265359
>>   end
>> end
=> :pi
>> Knowledge.pi
=> 3.14159265359
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fa5c28890b8>
>> example.pi
=> 3.14
>> exit
$
```

##### List of All Instance Methods

You can read out all defined methods for a class with the method
`instance_methods`. We try it out with the class `Knowledge` (first
we create it once again in the irb):

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Knowledge
>>   def pi
>>     3.14
>>   end
>> end
=> :pi
>> Knowledge.instance_methods
=> [:pi, :nil?, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :<=>, :class, 
:singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint, :tainted?, 
:untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :freeze, :frozen?, 
:to_s, :inspect, :methods, :singleton_methods, :protected_methods, 
:private_methods, :public_methods, :instance_variables, 
:instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set, 
:instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, 
:instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send, 
:respond_to?, :extend, :display, :method, :public_method, 
:singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum, 
:enum_for, :==, :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, 
:__send__, :__id__]
>>
```

But that is much more than we have defined! Why? It's because Ruby gives
every new class a basic set of methods by default. If we only want to
list the methods that we have defined, then we can do it like this:

```bash
>> Knowledge.instance_methods(false)
=> [:pi]
>> exit
$
```

Variables
---------

You already know that everything in Ruby is an object. So a variable
must also be an object.

### Naming Conventions

Normal variables are written in lower case. Constants start with an upper case letter.

> **Important**
>
> A constant can also be overwritten with a new value in Ruby (but you
> will get a warning message). So please do not rely on the constancy of
> a constant.

You are on the safe side if you are using only ASCII symbols. But with
Ruby 1.9 and the right encoding, you could also use special characters
(for example German umlauts) more or less without any problems in a
variable name. But if you want to be polite towards other programmers
who probably do not have those characters directly available on their
keyboards, it is better to use only pure ASCII.

### Strings

Let's experiment a little bit in the `irb`. The method `.class tells us which 
class we are dealing with.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 'First test'
=> "First test"
>> a.class
=> String
```

That was easy. As you can see, Ruby “automagically” creates an object of the 
class `String`. We could also do this by explicitly calling the method `new:

```bash
>> b = String.new('Second test')
=> "Second test"
>> b.class
=> String
```

If we call `String.new` without a parameter, this also creates an object
of the class `String`. But it is an empty String:

```bash
>> c = String.new
=> ""
>> c.class
=> String
>> exit
$
```

#### Single and Double Quotations Marks

> **Note**
>
> Please note: if we mention single or double quotation marks in the context of 
> strings, we do not mean typographically correct curly quotation marks 
> (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark>), but the ASCII symbols referred 
> to as *apostrophe* (`'`) or *quotation mark* (`"`).

Strings can be defined either in single quotes or double quotes. There is a special 
feature for the double quotes: you can integrate expressions with the construct `#{}`. 
The result is then automatically inserted in the corresponding place in the string.

Example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 'blue'
=> "blue"
>> b = "Color: #{a}"
=> "Color: blue"
>> b.class
=> String
>> exit
$
```

If the result of the expression is not a string, Ruby tries to apply the method `to_s` 
in order to convert the value of the object into a string.

### Integers
#### Fixnum and Bignum

`Fixnum` and `Bignum` are `Integer` classes. A `Fixnum` is an `Integer` that can
be saved in a “Word”. If a `Fixnum` gets bigger, it automatically becomes a `Bignum`. 
Here is an example where a becomes larger and by that becomes a `Bignum`.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 20.class
=> Fixnum
>> a = 20
=> 20
>> a.class
=> Fixnum
>> a = a * 5555555555
=> 111111111100
>> a.class
=> Fixnum
>> a = a * 5555555555
=> 617283950493827160500
>> a.class
=> Bignum
>> exit
$
```

#### Floats

`Float` is a class for real numbers (“floating point numbers”). The decimal separator 
is a point (not a comma, as in some European countries).

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 20.424
=> 20.424
>> a.class
=> Float
>> 42.2.class
=> Float
>> exit
$
```

#### Simple Calculations

Calculating with integers and floats is so easy that you can describe everything with 
just a few lines of code in the `irb`:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> b = 23
=> 23
>> a + b
=> 33
>> (a + b).class
=> Fixnum
>> c = a + b
=> 33
>> c.class
=> Fixnum
>> d = 3.14
=> 3.14
>> e = a + d
=> 13.14
>> e.class
=> Float
>> a * b
=> 230
>> (a * b).class
=> Fixnum
>> (a * b * d).class
=> Float
>> exit
$
```

### Boolean Values and nil

For boolean values (`true` and `false`) and for `nil` (no value) there are separate classes:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> true.class
=> TrueClass
>> false.class
=> FalseClass
>> nil.class
=> NilClass
>> exit
$
```

`nil` (no value) is, by the way, the contraction of the Latin word *nihil* (nothing) or, 
if you look at it in terms of programming history, the term derives from “*not in list*” 
from the legacy of the programming language Lisp (the name is an acronym of *List Processing*).

### Scope of Variables

Variables have a different scope (or “reach”) within the Ruby application and therefore 
also within a Ruby on Rails application.

> **Important**
>
> You need to keep this scope in mind while programming. Otherwise you can 
> end up with odd effects.

#### Local Variables (aaa or \_aaa)

Local variables either start with a lower case letter or an underscore (`_`). Their scope 
is limited to the current environment (for example the current method). The follwing 
example defines two methods which use the same local variable radius. Because they are 
local they don't interact with each other:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> def area(radius)
>>   3.14 * radius * radius
>> end
=> :area
>> def circumference(radius)
>>   2 * 3.14 * radius
>> end
=> :circumference
>> area(10)
=> 314.0
>> circumference(1)
=> 6.28
>> exit
$
```

#### Global Variables ($aaa)

A global variable starts with a `$`-sign and is accessible in the entire programm. Example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> $value = 10
=> 10
>> puts $value
10
=> nil
>> def example
>>   $value = 20
>> end
=> :example
>> puts $value
10
=> nil
>> example
=> 20
>> puts $value
20
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

Global variables are used very rarely.

#### Instance Variables (@aaa)

Instance variables (“**A**ttributes”, hence the `@`) only apply within a class, but 
everywhere in it – a mini version of global variables, so to speak. Unlike global 
variables, you will find instance variables all over the place in a Rails application. 
Let's tackle them in form of an example program with the name `color.rb`:

```ruby
class Wall
  def initialize
    @color = 'white'
  end

  def color
    @color
  end

  def paint_it(value)
    @color = value
  end
end

my_wall = Wall.new
puts my_wall.color

my_wall.paint_it('red')
puts my_wall.color
```

If you start this program, the following output will appear:

```bash
$ ruby color.rb
white
red
$
```

In the method `initialize` we set the instance variable `@color` to the value “white”. The 
method `paint_it(value)` changes this instance variable.

With the method `color` we can access the value of `@color` outside of the instance. This 
kind of method is called a setter method.

Methods Once Again
------------------

In order to keep the amount of chicken and egg problems in this chapter at a manageable 
level, we need to go back to the topic Methods and combine what we have learned so far.

### Getters and Setters

As instance variables Rubyinstance variables (“attributes”) only exist within the relevant 
instance, you always need to write a “getter” method for exporting such a variable. 
If we define a class `Room` that has the instance variables `@doors` and `@windows` (for 
the number of doors and windows in the room), then we can create the getter methods `doors` 
und `windows` (example program `room.rb`):

```ruby
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  def doors
    @doors
  end

  def windows
    @windows
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
```

The execution of the program:

```bash
$ ruby room.rb
D: 1
W: 1
$
```

As this scenario – wanting to simply return a value in identical form – is so common, there 
is already a ready-made getter method for it with the name `attr_reader`, which you 
would apply as follows in the program `room.rb`:

```ruby
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
```

`attr_reader` is a method which is called on the `Room` class. That is the reason why we use 
Symbols (e.g. :doors and :windows) instead of variables (e.g. @doors and @windows) 
as parameter.

> **Note**
>
> attr\_reader is a good example for meta programming in Ruby. When working with 
> Rails, you will frequently come across meta programming and be grateful for how 
> it works automagically.

If you want to change the number of doors or windows from the outside, you need 
a “setter” method. It can be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows

  def doors=(value)
    @doors = value
  end

  def windows=(value)
    @windows = value
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
```

The corresponding output is this:

```bash
$ ruby room.rb
D: 1
W: 2
$
```

As you can probably imagine, there is of course also a ready-made and easier way of 
doing this. Via the setter method `attr_writer` you can simplify the code of `room.rb` 
further:

```ruby
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
  attr_writer :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
```

And (who would have thought!) there is even a method `attr_accessor` that combines 
getters and setters. The code for `room.rb` would then look like this:

```ruby
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_accessor :doors, :windows
end


kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
```

### Built-In Methods for String

Most classes already come with a bundle of very useful methods. These methods are 
always written after the relevant object, separated by a point.

Here are a few examples for methods of the class `String`.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 'A dog'
=> "A dog"
>> a.class
=> String
>> a.size
=> 5
>> a.downcase
=> "a dog"
>> a.upcase
=> "A DOG"
>> a.reverse
=> "god A"
>> exit
$
```

With `instance_methods(false)` you can get a list of the build in methods:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> String.instance_methods(false)
=> [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp, :+, :*, :%, :[], :[]=, :insert, :length, 
:size, :bytesize, :empty?, :=~, :match, :succ, :succ!, :next, :next!, :upto, :index, 
:rindex, :replace, :clear, :chr, :getbyte, :setbyte, :byteslice, :scrub, :scrub!, 
:freeze, :to_i, :to_f, :to_s, :to_str, :inspect, :dump, :upcase, :downcase, 
:capitalize, :swapcase, :upcase!, :downcase!, :capitalize!, :swapcase!, :hex, :oct, 
:split, :lines, :bytes, :chars, :codepoints, :reverse, :reverse!, :concat, :<<, 
:prepend, :crypt, :intern, :to_sym, :ord, :include?, :start_with?, :end_with?, 
:scan, :ljust, :rjust, :center, :sub, :gsub, :chop, :chomp, :strip, :lstrip, :rstrip, 
:sub!, :gsub!, :chop!, :chomp!, :strip!, :lstrip!, :rstrip!, :tr, :tr_s, :delete, 
:squeeze, :count, :tr!, :tr_s!, :delete!, :squeeze!, :each_line, :each_byte, 
:each_char, :each_codepoint, :sum, :slice, :slice!, :partition, :rpartition, 
:encoding, :force_encoding, :b, :valid_encoding?, :ascii_only?, :unpack, :encode, 
:encode!, :to_r, :to_c, :unicode_normalize, :unicode_normalize!, :unicode_normalized?]
>> exit
$
```

If you are not sure what one of these methods does you can use `ri` to look it up:

```bash
$ ri String.size
= String.size

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  str.size     -> integer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns the character length of str.
```

### Method Chaining

You may not think of it straight away, but once you have got used to working with 
Ruby, then it makes perfect sense (and is perfectly logical) to chain different 
methods.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 'A dog'
=> "A dog"
>> a.upcase.reverse
=> "GOD A"
>> exit
$
```

### Converting from One to the Other: Casting

There is a whole range of useful instance methods for converting (“casting”) objects 
from one class to another. First, let's use the method `.to_s` to convert a `Fixnum` 
to a `String`.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> a.class
=> Fixnum
>> b = a.to_s
=> "10"
>> b.class
=> String
>> exit
$
```

> **Note**
>
> Incidentally, that is exactly what `puts` does if you use `puts` to output a `Fixnum` 
> or a `Float` (for non-strings, it simply implicitly adds the method `.to_s` and 
> outputs the result).

Now we use the method `.to_i` to change a `Float` to a `Fixnum`.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> c = 10.0
=> 10.0
>> c.class
=> Float
>> d = c.to_i
=> 10
>> d.class
=> Fixnum
>> exit
$
```

### Method to\_s for Your Own Classes

You should always integrate a method `to_s` for your own custom classes, even if it is 
just for the sake of easier debugging. Then you can simply output a corresponding 
object via `puts` (`puts` automatically outputs an object via the method `to_s`).

Here is an example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> class Person
>>   def initialize(first_name, last_name)
>>     @first_name = first_name
>>     @last_name = last_name
>>   end
>>   def to_s
>>     "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
>>   end
>> end
=> :to_s
>> person1 = Person.new('Stefan', 'Wintermeyer')
=> #<Person:0x007ffeaa84af98 @first_name="Stefan", @last_name="Wintermeyer">
>> puts person1
Stefan Wintermeyer
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

### Is “+” a Method?

Why is there also a plus symbol in the list of methods for String? Let's find out by 
looking it up in `ri`:

```bash
$ ri -T String.+
String.+

(from ruby site)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  str + other_str   -> new_str
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Concatenation---Returns a new String containing other_str
concatenated to str.

  "Hello from " + self.to_s   #=> "Hello from main"
$
```

hmmm … Let's see what it says for `Fixnum`:

```bash
$ ri -T Fixnum.+
Fixnum.+

(from ruby site)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  fix + numeric  ->  numeric_result
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Performs addition: the class of the resulting object depends on the class of
numeric and on the magnitude of the result.

$
```

Let's have a go and play around with this in `irb`. So we should be able to add 
the + to an object, just as any other method, separated by a dot and add the 
second number in brackets as parameter:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 10 + 10
=> 20
>> 10+10
=> 20
>> 10.+10
=> 20
>> 10.+(10)
=> 20
>> exit
$
```

Aha! The plus symbol is indeed a method, and this method takes the next value as 
parameter. Really we should put this value in brackets, but thanks to Ruby's 
well thought-out syntax this is not necessary.

#### Can I Overwrite the Method +?

Yes, you can overwrite any method. Logically, this does not make much sense for 
methods such as `+`, unless you want to drive your fellow programmers mad. I am 
going to show you a little demo in `irb` so you will believe me.

The aim is overwriting the method `+` for `Fixnum`. We want the result of every 
addition to be the number 42.

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 10 + 10
=> 20
>> class Fixnum
>>   def +(name, *args, &blk)
>>     42
>>   end
>> end
=> :+
>> 10 + 10
=> 42
>> exit
$
```

First we perform a normal addition. Than we redefine the method `+` for the class 
`Fixnum`, and after that we do the calculation again. But this time, with different 
results.

if-Condition
------------

An abstract `if`-condition looks like this:

```ruby
if expression
  program
end
```

The program between the expression and `end` is executed if the result of the 
expression is not `false` and not `nil`.

> **Note**
>
> You can also use a `then` after the expression:
>
>     if expression
>       program
>     end

The construct for a simple `if`-branch in a Ruby program looks like the following 
example program:

```ruby
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
end
```

> **Note**
>
> The `'=='` is used to compare two values. Please don't mix it up with the single `'='`.

You can try an *expression* really well in `irb`:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> a == 10
=> true
>> exit
$
```

### Shorthand

A frequently used shorthand notation of an `if`-condition can be found in the following 
code:

```ruby
a = 10

# long version
#
if a == 10 then
  puts 'a is 10'
end

# short version
#
puts 'a is 10' if a == 10
```

### else

You can probably imagine how this works, but for the sake of completeness, 
here is a little example:

```ruby
a = 10

if a == 10 then
  puts 'a is 10'
else
  puts 'a is not 10'
end
```

### elsif

Again, most programmers will know what this is all about. Example:

```ruby
a = 10

if a == 10 then
  puts 'a is 10'
elsif a == 20 then
  puts 'a is 20'
end
```

Loops
-----

There are different ways of implementing loops in Ruby. The iterator variation 
is used particularly often in the Rails environment.

### while and until

An abstract while loop looks like this:

```ruby
while expression do
  program
end
```

> **Note**
>
> The `do` that follows the `expression` is optional. Often you will also see this:
>
>     while expression
>       program
>     end

Here is a practical `irb` example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> i = 0
=> 0
>> while i < 3 do
?>   puts i
>>   i = i + 1
>> end
0
1
2
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

Until loops are built similarly:

```ruby
until expression
  program
ends
```

Again, here is the corresponding `irb` example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> i = 5
=> 5
>> until i == 0
>>   i = i - 1
>>   puts i
>> end
4
3
2
1
0
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

### Blocks and Iterators

“Block” and “iterator” are some of the favorite words of many Ruby programmers. 
Now I am going to show you why.

In the loop

```ruby
5.times { |i| puts i }
```

`i` is the iterator and `puts i` is the block.

You can also express the whole thing in the following syntax:

```ruby
5.times do |i|
  puts i
end
```

#### Iterators

Iterators are just a specific type of method. As you probably know, the word 
“*iterate*” means to repeat something. For example, the class Fixnum has 
the iterator times() Rubytimes. Let's see what help `ri` offers us:

```bash
$ ri -T Fixnum.times
Fixnum.times

(from ruby site)
Implementation from Integer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int.times {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.times               ->  an_enumerator
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterates block int times, passing in values from zero to int -
1.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  5.times do |i|
    print i, " "
  end

produces:

  0 1 2 3 4
$ 
```

And it also gives a nice example that we are going to try out in irb:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 5.times do |i|
?>   puts i
>> end
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> exit
$
```

There is also a single-line notation for small blocks:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 5.times { |i| puts i }
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> exit
$
```

By the way, an iterator does not necessarily have to pass a variable to the block:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 5.times { puts 'example' }
example
example
example
example
example
=> 5
>> exit
$
```

#### Blocks

A block is the code that is triggered by an iterator. In the block, you have 
access to the local variable(s) passed by the iterator.

#### Method upto

Apart from `times` there is also the method `upto`, for easily implementing a loop. 
`ri` offers a nice example for this, too:

```bash
$ ri -T Fixnum.upto
Fixnum.upto

(from ruby site)
Implementation from Integer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int.upto(limit) {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.upto(limit)               ->  an_enumerator
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterates block, passing in integer values from int up to and
including limit.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  5.upto(10) { |i| print i, " " }

produces:

  5 6 7 8 9 10

$
```

Arrays and Hashes
-----------------

As in many programming languages, *arrays* and *hashes* are popular structures 
in Ruby for storing data.

### Arrays

An array is a list of objects. Let's play around in `irb:`

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = [1,2,3,4,5]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> exit
$
```

That is simple and easy to understand.

Let's see if it also works with strings in the array:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = ['Test', 'Banana', 'blue']
=> ["Test", "Banana", "blue"]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> a[1]
=> "Banana"
>> a[1].class
=> String
>> exit
$
```

That also works.

So all that's missing now is an array with a mixture of both. Obviously that 
will work, too, because the array stores objects and it does not matter which 
kind of objects they are (i.e. `String`, `Fixnum`, `Float`, …). But a little test 
can't hurt:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = [1, 2.2, 'House', nil]
=> [1, 2.2, "House", nil]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> a[0]
=> 1
>> a[0].class
=> Fixnum
>> a[2]
=> "House"
>> a[2].class
=> String
>> exit
$
```

Next, let's have a look at what the `ri` help page says for `Array`:

```bash
$ ri -T Array
Array < Object

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Includes:
Enumerable (from ruby site)

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing
starts at 0, as in C or Java.  A negative index is assumed to be relative to
the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of
the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class methods:

  []
  new
  try_convert

Instance methods:

  &
  *
  +
  -
  <<

[...]

$ 
```

As you can see, arrays can also be created via the method `new` (like any class). 
Individual new elements can then be added at the end of an array via the method 
`<<`. Here is the corresponding example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = Array.new
=> []
>> a << 'first item'
=> ["first item"]
>> a << 'second item'
=> ["first item", "second item"]
>> exit
$
```

#### Iterator each

You can work your way through an array piece by piece via the method `each`. 
Example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> cart = ['eggs', 'butter']
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> cart.each do |item|
?>   puts item
>> end
eggs
butter
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> exit
$
```

Once more, `ri` provides help and an example in case you forget how to
use each:

```bash
$ ri -T Array.each
Array.each

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ary.each {|item| block }   -> ary
  ary.each                   -> an_enumerator
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calls block once for each element in self, passing that element
as a parameter.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  a = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
  a.each {|x| print x, " -- " }

produces:

  a -- b -- c --

$
```

### Hashes
 
A “*Hash*” is a list of *key/value pairs*. Here is an example with strings as keys:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> prices = { 'egg' => 0.1, 'butter' => 0.99 }
=> {"egg"=>0.1, "butter"=>0.99}
>> prices['egg']
=> 0.1
>> prices.count
=> 2
>> exit
$
```

Of course, hashes can store not just strings as objects in the values, 
but - as with arrays - also classes that you define yourself 
(see [the section called "Arrays"](http://www.xyzpub.com/en/ruby-on-rails/4.0/ruby-array-und-hash.html#ruby_array)).

#### Symbols

*Symbols* are a strange concept and difficult to explain. But they are very useful 
and used frequently, amongst others with hashes. Normally, variables always create 
new objects:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> a = 'Example 1'
=> "Example 1"
>> a.object_id
=> 70124141350360
>> a = 'Example 2'
=> "Example 2"
>> a.object_id
=> 70124141316700
>> exit
$
```

In both cases, we have the variable `a`, but object ID is different. We could carry 
on in this way indefinitely. Each time, it would generate a different object ID and 
therefore a new object. In principle, this is no big deal and entirely logical in 
terms of object orientation. But it is also rather a waste of memory space.

A symbol is defined by a colon before the name and cannot store any values itself, 
but it always has the same object ID, so it is very well suited to be a *key*:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> :a.class
=> Symbol
>> :a.object_id
=> 702428
>> exit
$
```

Let's do another little experiment to make the difference clearer. We use a string 
object with the content “`white`” three times in a row and then the symbol `:white` 
three times in a row. For `"white"`, a new object is created each time. For the 
symbol `:white`, only the first time:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874305700
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874300640
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874271720
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> exit
$
```

Using symbols as key for hashes is much more memory efficient:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> colors = { black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> puts colors[:white]
#FFFFFF
=> nil
>> exit
$
```

You will frequently see symbols in Rails. If you want to find out more about 
symbols, go to the help page about the class Symbol via `ri Symbol`.

#### Iterator each

With the method `each` you can work your way through a `Hash` step by step. 
Example:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> colors = {black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> colors.each do |key, value|
?>   puts "#{key} #{value}"
>> end
black #000000
white #FFFFFF
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> exit
$
```

Again, `ri` offers help and an example, in case you cannot remember one day 
how to use each:

```bash
$ ri -T Hash.each
Hash.each

(from ruby site)

  hsh.each      {| key, value | block } -> hsh
  hsh.each_pair {| key, value | block } -> hsh
  hsh.each                              -> an_enumerator
  hsh.each_pair                         -> an_enumerator
   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calls block once for each key in hsh, passing the key-value pair
as parameters.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  h = { "a" => 100, "b" => 200 }
  h.each {|key, value| puts "#{key} is #{value}" }

produces:

  a is 100
  b is 200

### Range

The class Range represents an interval. The start and end points of the interval 
are defined enclosed in normal brackets and separated by two dots in between them. 
Here is an example in which we use a range like an iterator with each:

```bash
$ irb --simple-prompt
>> (0..3)
=> 0..3
>> (0..3).class
=> Range
>> (0..3).each do |i|
?>   puts i
>> end
0
1
2
3
=> 0..3
>>
```

Via the method `to_a` you can generate an array from a `Range`:

```bash
>> (0..3).to_a
=> [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>
```

A range can be generated from objects of any type. Important is only that the 
objects can be compared via `<=>` and use the method `succ` for counting on to 
the next value. So you can also use `Range` to represent letters:

```bash
>> ('a'..'h').to_a
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
>>
```

As alternative notation, you may sometimes come across `Range.new()`. In this 
case, the start and end points are not separated by two dots, but by a comma. 
This is what it looks like:

```bash
>> (0..3) == Range.new(0,3)
=> true
>> exit
$
```
